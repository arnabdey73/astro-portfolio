# Portfolio Data Migration Summary

I've extracted the key content from your old portfolio repository at [arnabdey73/arnabdey73.github.io](https://github.com/arnabdey73/arnabdey73.github.io) and structured it into reusable data files for your new Astro-based portfolio.

## Files Created

### Data Files

- **`personal.json`**: Your personal information, including name, title, tagline, contact details, and social links.
- **`skills.json`**: Your technical skills organized by categories with proficiency levels.
- **`projects.json`**: Your portfolio projects with descriptions, technologies used, and GitHub links.
- **`experience.json`**: Your work experience with role details, responsibilities, and technologies.
- **`certifications.json`**: Your professional certifications with details and links.
- **`contact.json`**: Your contact information and preferences.
- **`site.json`**: General site metadata, SEO information, and support links.
- **`open-source.json`**: Your open source contributions and repositories.
- **`about.md`**: Your about page content in Markdown format.

### Utility Functions

- **`portfolio-data.js`**: Helper functions to easily access and use this data throughout your Astro site.

## Data Structure

The data is structured in a way that makes it:

1. **Reusable**: Can be imported and used across multiple components/pages
2. **Maintainable**: Easy to update in one place
3. **Consistent**: Following similar patterns for all content types
4. **Expandable**: Easy to add more content in the future

## Image Assets

Please note that you'll need to manually copy image assets from your old repository to:
`/public/assets/img/`

Key images to include:
- Profile/avatar picture
- Portfolio thumbnail
- Project screenshots/thumbnails
- Background images
- Favicon/icons

## Next Steps

With this structured data in place, you can now:

1. Use the utility functions to load this data in your Astro components
2. Build out the visual components using Tailwind CSS
3. Implement dynamic content rendering using the extracted data
4. Copy over any missing image assets 

This approach ensures your content is cleanly separated from your presentation layer, making future updates easier.
