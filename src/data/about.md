# About Me

## My Journey

With over 14 years of experience in the IT industry, I've evolved from a system administrator to a specialized Cloud & DevOps Engineer. My career path has been driven by a passion for automation, infrastructure optimization, and modern cloud-native solutions.

I began my journey managing on-premise infrastructure, where I developed a strong foundation in system administration and networking fundamentals. As cloud technologies emerged, I pivoted my career focus toward Azure and AWS platforms, recognizing the transformative potential of cloud computing.

Today, I specialize in designing and implementing robust cloud infrastructures using Infrastructure as Code principles. I'm particularly passionate about creating elegant automation solutions that enhance efficiency, reliability, and security.

## My Approach

I believe in a pragmatic approach to technology implementation:

- **Business-First Mindset**: Technology choices should be guided by business outcomes, not just technical novelty
- **Automation by Default**: Investing in automation pays dividends in reliability, consistency, and team efficiency
- **Security as a Process**: Security must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not added as an afterthought
- **Continuous Learning**: The cloud landscape evolves rapidly, requiring consistent dedication to learning and adaptation

## Core Competencies

- **Cloud Architecture**: Designing scalable, resilient, and cost-effective cloud solutions
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through code for consistency and version control
- **CI/CD Pipeline Design**: Creating efficient delivery pipelines that enhance productivity
- **Cloud Security**: Implementing defense-in-depth security controls
- **Cost Optimization**: Finding the balance between performance and cost-efficiency

## Outside Work

When I'm not working with cloud technologies, I enjoy hiking in Sweden's beautiful landscapes, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring new programming languages. I'm also an avid reader of technical books and blogs, constantly expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
