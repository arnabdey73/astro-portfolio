# Contact Form Email Setup Guide

## Current Issue
Your contact form was configured for Netlify Forms, but your site is deployed on Vercel. This means emails weren't being sent because Netlify's form handling isn't available on Vercel.

## Solution: Formspree Integration

I've updated your contact form to use Formspree, which works perfectly with Vercel and any hosting platform.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a Formspree Account**
   - Go to [https://formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
   - Sign up with your email address
   - Verify your email

2. **Create a New Form**
   - In your Formspree dashboard, click "New Form"
   - Enter your email address where you want to receive contact form submissions
   - Copy the form endpoint URL (it will look like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxxx`)

3. **Update the Form Configuration**
   - Replace the current form action URL in `contact.astro` with your actual Formspree endpoint
   - Find this line in your contact form:
   ```html
   <form class="mt-8 space-y-6" id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/xovqdjwn" method="POST">
   ```
   - Replace `xovqdjwn` with your actual form ID

4. **Update JavaScript Endpoint**
   - In the JavaScript section, find this function:
   ```javascript
   async function submitToFormspree(formData: FormData): Promise<boolean> {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xovqdjwn', {
   ```
   - Replace `xovqdjwn` with your actual form ID

### Testing the Form

1. **Deploy Your Changes**
   - Commit and push your changes to trigger a new deployment on Vercel

2. **Test the Form**
   - Fill out your contact form with test data
   - Submit the form
   - Check your email for the submission

3. **Verify Formspree Dashboard**
   - Log into your Formspree account
   - You should see the submission in your dashboard

### Formspree Features

- **Free Tier**: 50 submissions per month
- **Spam Protection**: Built-in spam filtering
- **Email Notifications**: Instant email delivery
- **File Uploads**: Support for file attachments (if needed)
- **Custom Redirect**: After form submission (optional)

### Troubleshooting

If emails still aren't working:

1. **Check Spam Folder**: Form submissions might go to spam initially
2. **Verify Email**: Ensure your Formspree account email is verified
3. **Check Form ID**: Double-check that both the form action and JavaScript use the same form ID
4. **Browser Console**: Check for any JavaScript errors during submission

### Alternative: Custom Backend Solution

If you prefer a custom solution, I can help you set up:

1. **Vercel Serverless Functions**: Custom API endpoint for email sending
2. **Resend Integration**: Professional email service
3. **SendGrid Integration**: Another reliable email service
